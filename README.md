# Mobile Food Ordering System

## Course Information
This project is an assignment for the course **BERR 1233: Data Structure and Algorithms**.

## Project Overview
The **Mobile Food Ordering System** is a console-based application that allows users to place food orders from a menu. The system manages orders using various data structures, providing a user-friendly interface for ordering food items.

## Key Features
This project demonstrates the following key data structures and algorithms:

1. **Array**: Used to store the prices and names of menu items.
2. **Linked List**: Manages the current orders placed by the user, allowing for dynamic addition and removal of orders.
3. **Stack**: Keeps track of the order history, enabling the user to undo the last order placed.
4. **Sorting**: Implements a bubble sort algorithm to sort items based on the quantity ordered before displaying the receipt.

## Requirements
- This project is designed to run on **Windows** due to the use of the `windows.h` library.
- If you attempt to run this project in an online compiler (such as Programiz, Replit, etc.), you will encounter errors related to the `windows.h` library.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fit03/Mobile-Food-Ordering-System.git
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (such as Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or Dev-C++).
3. Compile and run the program.
